# Hello everyone ðŸŒ¸ 

<p>
I created this project to deepen my understanding of React Native through hands-on implementation. Along the way, I documented key concepts and insights that I believe will serve as a valuable reference when revisiting this project. Detailed documentation is crucial for navigating older projects effectively, so take your time, stay focused, and don't get discouraged!

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

#### 1. [Set up project ðŸ¤—](#project-Set-up-bash-commands)


## project Set-up bash commands ðŸ¤—

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest
npm run reset-project
```
### make sure that your react native app works 
```js
  the first step is to create app folder and _layout.jsx and index.jsx files and return any text
```
### Breakdown of Key Folders:
```bash

components/ â€“ Stores reusable UI components like buttons, task items, or modals.
screens/ â€“ Each app screen (e.g., Home, Task Details) is stored separately.
navigation/ â€“ Keeps all navigation-related code (e.g., Stack, Tab navigators).
context/ â€“ If using Context API, keep global state management here.
hooks/ â€“ Custom hooks for managing app logic (e.g., useTasks.js).
services/ â€“ Handles API requests, local storage, or any external services.
utils/ â€“ Stores helper functions like date formatters or string manipulators.
constants/ â€“ Defines constant values like colors, routes, and action types.

```
### Challenge use this advanced file structure in your app : 

```bash
/todo-app
â”‚â”€â”€ /src
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ /components        
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ TaskItem.js    
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ /screens

â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ /navigation        
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ AppNavigator.js
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ /context

â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ App.js             
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ index.js
